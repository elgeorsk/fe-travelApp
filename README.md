# Project Instructions

## Getting started

Remember that once you clone, you will still need to install everything:

`cd` into your new folder and run:
- `npm install`

You can run the project in `development` or `production` mode by using the following commands:

- Development mode: `npm run build-dev`
- Production mode: `npm run build-prod`

Note: scripts can be found in `package.json`

## Setting up the API

## Deploying

A great step to take with your finished project would be to deploy it!
